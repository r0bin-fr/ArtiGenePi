# artigene
This project is to make Artisan work for Gene Cafe CBR 101 (Coffee roaster) using a Raspberry Pi3. 

This implies realisation of a Bluetooth temperature sensor (inspired from www.roasthacker.com) and make Raspberry get the temperature remotely, then pass it to Artisan roaster software through local socket. 

In addition, I put an SSR to be able to dim the heat power, for an optimal roasting process.
